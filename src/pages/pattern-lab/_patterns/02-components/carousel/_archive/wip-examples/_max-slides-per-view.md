title: Max Slides Per View
---

The default, 'auto', will display 1 slide at a time at the smallest screen sizes, up to 2 at a time starting at <code>xsmall</code> screen sizes, 3 slides at a time starting at <code>medium</code> screen sizes, up to 4 slides at a time starting at <code>large</code> screen sizes, and up to 5 slides at a time starting at <code>xlarge</code> screen sizes and larger. Note: carousels that contain <em>less than this ideal number</em> will automatically limit the max number of slides to display to the total number of slides available, based on the ideal number for that particular screen size.
