<h3>Direct links to Micro Journey pages</h3>
<p>This is helpful for IE to use since navigating via the PL menu opens up many of these pages together which can be slow. Bookmark this page in IE11!</p>
<ul>
  {% for key, value in link %}
    {% if 'experiments-micro-journeys' in value %}
      <li><a href="{{ value }}">{{ key }}</a></li>
