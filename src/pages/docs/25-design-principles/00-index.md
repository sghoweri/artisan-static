The Digital team at Pegasystems creates, maintains and continuously improves the websites that help people learn, build with, sell and buy Pega applications. The 5+ digital properties we work on span internal and external audiences across offices in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. The following principles help us deliver effective, thoughtful design for the Bolt Design System. 

## Clarity > Cleverness.

When information isn't clear, it doesn't matter how clever it is. Use plain language and avoid jargon, especially in helper text. Use animation cautiously - it should assist user interaction, rather than obfuscating it.

## Accessibility is not optional.

Thinking about accessibility is more than just caring about screen readers. Designing for accessibility helps people with low vision, color blindness and other minor visual issues best interact with our work. [It also helps with SEO](https://webaim.org/blog/web-accessibility-and-seo/).

## Consider the ecosystem.

Everything we create fits into a broader digital ecosystem. Understand where the pieces we are working on fit within that ecosystem, and how we can reuse elements to create visual and UI consistency.

## Make it shine.

Usability isn't just about functionality or interaction design. If pages load slowly, or the experience lacks visual polish, the user experience suffers. Everything we create should take care to represent Pega in the best possible light.
