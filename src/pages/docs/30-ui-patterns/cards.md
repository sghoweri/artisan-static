title: Cards

*For full examples with variations and API docs, see the [cards reference in Pattern Lab](/pattern-lab/?p=viewall-components-card).*

A card allows content authors to highlight a specific type of related content. It can include a video, a link to an webpage or download, or some other call to action. Cards are available in all color themes.

## Best Practices

### Try to use singles or multiples of 3.

Cards are best used as either a single card within a Content Body band, or as a set of 3 cards in a single band. Try not to use even numbers of cards.

### Focus cards on a clear benefit to the visitor.

Use cards to call out specific, concise, links to related information within the context of a flow. Keep descriptions brief and scannable, and make it clear how this information is beneficial to the visitor.

### Structure content and calls to action consistently.

Retain similar line lengths for headings and descriptions. Use either a bottom CTA link or a linked heading, but not both. To avoid cluttering the page, prefer linked headings to adding bottom CTAs, especially if the page has a number of other calls to action.
